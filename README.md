# Presentations

>This repository is intended for hosting and sharing all the presentations I give in real life. I share these publicly through GitHub so that anyone can access (portions of) them and share their contents.

To access the mark-up code for the presentations, simply open the *gh-pages* branch. They have all been developed using RevealJS, a package which is great for quickly making beautiful online-based presentations. Check out https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/

The presentations can also be viewed in their true glory at:
